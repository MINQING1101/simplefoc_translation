# DRV8302 driver with Arduino UNO 

DRV8302 is a high performance BLDC driver board capable of delivering 15A current continuously and 27A peak current. It has temperature and over-current protection, it has Back EMF and three phase current sensing and last but not the least it can be run using only 3PWM signals making it compatible with the <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span>.

Here is an example of the connection scheme using the Arduino UNO:

You can find this board on [Aliexpress <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/4000126430773.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.702a312aXmzuUK&algo_pvid=50131a88-ac88-4755-bb71-978c07ec461e&algo_expid=50131a88-ac88-4755-bb71-978c07ec461e-5&btsid=0b0a119a15957548552557385e6f5e&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_) for the price of ~35$

## DRV8302 
- As any other BLDC driver supported with this library the board receives 3PWM signals: pwm `a`,`b` and `c`. Connect them to `INHA`, `INHB` and `INHC`
- Additionally connect the enable pin as well to `EN-GATE` pin
- To configure the BLDC driver we will need three pins (purple)
   - `M_PWM` when `high` enables 3PWM mode (if `low` the board expects 6PWM signals)
   - `M_OC` when `low` enables over-current protection 
   - `OC_ADJ` analog input adjusting the over-current limit - if you don't care you can put it to `high`
- To read the fault signals we will need to read two pins (red)
   - `nFAULT` when in `high` board in fault state
   - `nOCTW` when in `high` over-current limit reached

## Encoder 
- Channels `A` and `B` are connected to the external interrupt pins `2` and `3`
- If your encoder has `index` signal you can connect it to any available digital pin, here we connected it to the pin `4`

## Motor
- Motor phases `a`, `b` and `c` are connected directly the board terminals `OUTA`, `OUTB` and `OUTC`
